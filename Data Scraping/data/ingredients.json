Although the most common type is large and dark purple, eggplant comes in many sizes (2-12 inches), shapes (oblong to round), and colors (white to green to purple). The first varieties of eggplant known to English-speaking people bore colorful eggshaped fruits, thus the name eggplant. At one time eggplant was discounted as poisonous and dubbed the \"mala insane\" (raging apple) because it was believed to cause insanity.",
