Now a friend of mine who has had Falafel in Israel liked them though she agreed they were a bit dry and suggested adding a small amount of extra virgin olive oil to the mix. I may try this again adding oil and doubling the spices, if I do I'll update my review.\nSee More  ",

They were crispy on the outside and super tender in the middle. They had really good flavor too even though I had no coriander nor cilantro. A couple things I'd do different next time, and recommend to others: 1) Careful not to chop/puree the chickpea mixture too much. I over-did it and they were a bit too runny. Stop when the mixture is still a bit course. 2) When deep-frying I found they did best at 350 degrees for 5 minutes (though I found another recipe telling me 375, I thought they came out too dark at that temp). 3) Sprinkle with course salt immediately after removing from the frier, the salt will stick better when they are still hot.\nSee More  ",

I used fresh chives and basil instead of dried, as I had them on hand. I also used two colors of pepper, yellow & green (next time I'll definitely use red for the color). This was super easy to make. I peeled the veggies but then remembered your intro saying we don't have to, so next time I won't and it'll be even easier! The red onion, olive oil & balsamic caramelized in the oven and added even more flavor than I thought possible. I love eggplant, especially roasted (the first way I ever ate it), but I have to say that the potatoes kept a little firmness & caramelized just a bit that they turned out to be my favorites. I wish I'd put in more of them (12 oz was only two small potatoes). My toddler DD really enjoyed this recipe as well (except the green pepper) and if she'll eat it all gone then it's a good recipe!

I picked out all the kalamata which wasn't quite 3/4 of a cup and filled the cup with a variety of the other olives to get the correct amount - it worked and the taste was superb. I did find that a drained can of garbanzo beans is a scant 1 1/2 cups worth so I went with it. I did not add any water to thin out - it was the perfect consistency for us. I served it with baby carrots, sliced cucumbers and thin sesame rice crackers. I'm looking forward to serving this for company!\n ",

The salt on the cucumbers ABSOLUTELY needs to be reduced to 1 teaspoon, not 1 tablespoon, and I wonder if that was just a typo when the recipe was input? Others have complained of a watery result and I'll say: 1) you HAVE to use GREEK yogurt. It should be thick enough to stand a fork up in. 2) after salting and pressing for 30 minutes, ring out the cucumber. I'd suggest wrapping them in a smooth towel if you have one and squeezing with all your might. (The cucumber bits will get caught in the loops of a terry towel, and will be too wet for a paper towel probably.) I also leave the skin on the cucumber which works perfectly fine--just a bit more color and texture. I serve this with Greek pilaf rice and Iranian kubideh (basically, lamb meatball).\n ",

I needed it in a hurry, so grated the cucumber really, really fine, as Stevee D mentioned, and drained it (saving the juice for coctails!), then soaked up the remaining liquid with a paper towel. Hopefully it won't be too watery come morning, but the cuke was quite dry to the touch when I put it in. Anyway, delicious! (Also, I should mention that I used very, very thick homemade yogurt from the Greek market, and just used a whisk for mixing.)\n ",

I placed the Greek cream cheese in the food processor with the cucumber, garlic, dill, lemon juice & pepper. Scrape down the sides frequently and pulse until smooth.

I added a few things to enhance it even further for myself and for fun!!! First, I salted and removed the bitterness of the eggplant then roasted it using recipe # 357852 , recipe#357852,,that I really love the method and flavor of. This really sent the flavor of the eggplant into the stratosphere and lessened the time it needed to be in the skillet. I used fire-roasted tomatoes, threw in some chopped black olives and in place of parsley, I used arugula. This recipe is wonderful, it has great flavor, balance and you can tweak it with a few different veggies here and there that won't change the delicious outcome!!! Thanks so much for the recipe!!!\n ",

The flavors were great, though I did add fresh basil (another thing from our CSA box that needs to be used up) as well as some hot pepper flakes.

It's hearty, warming, and inviting, and has a greatly satisfying texture and consistency. Last night, I'd added some diced red & green bell peppers and finely chopped baby spinach. If sodium isn't an issue for someone, a bouillon cube adds a flavor boost, as does 1/2 tsp. of crushed Italian seasoning. It's tasty with Middle Eastern spices added or great with curry powder or curry paste added for a more exotic faux Mulligatawny variation. Your favorite salsa, picante sauce, a small can of green chilies, or Southwest-style diced tomatoes can change it up easily for a different twist on it, with a handful of crushed tortilla chips or even a few Fritos also tossed into it. Wonderful way to use up any leftover roasted or rotisserie chicken too. Beans, lentils, and peas work great in it also, and when I'm feeling particularly decadent, I quarter 2 hotdog-sized Polska kielbasa sausage links length-wise, and then dice the quarters into small pieces, to give it a hint of rich sausage flavor. Diced leftover Italian sausage or meatballs work well in it, also. It's hard to go wrong with this soup, since the recipe is both so good and also extremely versatile, so it can be made often and enjoyed in a variety of ways.\n ",

I did however, substituted 2 (14.5 oz.) cans chicken broth for the water, (which I got 3-1/2 cups of broth) and I also substituted Mrs. Dash Tableblend Salt-Free Seasoning for the regular salt. I accidentally added 1/4 tsp. black pepper, (instead of the 1/8 tsp. which the recipe called for) but it still tasted great. I also added the whole (15 oz.) can of Progresso's Cannellini Beans, (drained) but I added it during the last 10 minutes of cooking time, when I added the ditalini (so they wouldn't become mushy). Who ever makes this recipe, please don't forget to add the canned tomatoes, which wasn't mentioned (to add it) in the directions. I will definitely be making this soup again. Thanx for recipe Uncle Bill.\n ",

I eased up by just a bit on the olive oil and red wind vinegar but I don't think the whole amount would make much difference. Also, I used about 4 parts parsley to 1-2 parts mint which I got from my garden and is stronger than the stuff you buy in the store. I probably had at least a full 3/4 cup of parsley when chopped. To me, it is hard to determine how much \"one bunch\" is, so that's how I handled it. GREAT, GREAT recipe. Seriously the best Tabouleh Salad I have ever made.\nSee More  ",

The flavors came together perfectly and it was a huge hit! The whole room wanted the \"recipe\". Since then, when I make tabouli, I often add a can of Albacore tuna to the mix and Wa La(!) - an excellent meal that is appreciated by all. Top with a slice of avocado and you have heaven on a plate. Without fail, recipe requests follow the first bite. It just works. In-joy.\nSee More  ",

        "content": "Tabbouleh has always been something I wanted to make, and this recipe is the one I will use every time! I substituted Quinoa in place of the bulgur, using 1 1/2 cups of dry Quinoa to 3 cups of water and cooking it according to the directions on its package. This made the perfect amount of Quinoa to veggie ratio since I prefer a more balanced salad. Any less Quinoa & I think the parsley would have been too dominant. I used curly leaf parsley, which to me seemed to be just as flavorful as flat leaf but not as pungent. I chopped it very finely & took other's advice & measured 3/4 cup to 1 cup loosely packed. My \"1 bunch\" of green onions was 6 onions, & I used the whole onion-- both the green & the white. Where the recipe calls for 1 medium onion chopped, I only added 1/4 chopped to the salad, & it was a little too strong even with such a small amount. So I suggest using a mild or sweet onion or leaving it out altogether; I thought the green onions gave it great flavor on their own. I used fresh garden mint as well & only needed 1/4 cup or less after it was chopped. I used 16oz fresh cherry tomatoes quartered, & kept the olive oil & red wine vinegar as stated. Quinoa can be a little sticky so the oil really helped keep the texture of traditional tabbouleh. My only additions were 1 English cucumber finely chopped, which boosted the texture & flavor immensely, & about 2Tbls of balsamic vinegar to give the salad just a little bit of sweet without having to worry about granules of sugar showing up in the salad. I served this wonderful dish with hummus, pita bread, kalamata olives, & marinated Greek chicken kabobs (recipe was from a different website). Everyone loved it all!!

However, maybe I should have bought the salted ones that are usually served as an appetizer? I used green pistachios without shells that I bought that way. They might be smaller and more delicate than the salted variety. Well, I could try those or add toasted pine nuts (maybe leave them whole) or hazelnuts. The taste of the salad was very similar to the tuna salad I usually make which contains onions, olive oil, capers and lots of fresh parsley.

Added lots of basil (don't forget the basil)! Thanks very much for posting. This is going straight in my 100-star cookbook.\nSee More  ",

If the recipe turned out the way I was hoping it would, I would use it for our rehersal dinner for when my second DD gets married. We loved it! The salad had the crunch from the beans, sweetness from the tomatoes and salt from the cheese and olives!! I am not a big fan of oil floating around my foods (in fact, it turns me off totally!!) so I did make some changes. I had made a garlic infused oil (for another recipe) and had some of the oil and cooked garlic left over. I used some of the sun-dried tomato oil and the garlic infused oil and the left over garlic chips. I probably did not use even 1 T. It passed the \"bride has to try everything and see everything\" test and loved it!!! I dehydrate roma tomatoes when they come on sale... so next time, I will use half of my tomatoes and half of the oil infused tomatoes to use them up. If anybody else buys edamame at Costco, 3 cotainers equals just shy 2 cups. I have company coming in the next 2 weeks, so I think this recipe will get a good workout from me!

The only changes made were: I snipped the sun-dried tomatoes into small bits and by the time I had added about 2/3 cup of them to the edamame it looked like more would overwhelm the salad, so I didn't triple the amount of sun-dried tomatoes, but sliced and added about a pound of fresh ripe cherry tomatoes, instead. I couldn't find feta cheese, so substituted goat cheese (I read that it's a healthier cheese, anyway, with less fat and less salt). For the dressing (step 2), I decided I would like my garlic pureed, so I mixed the dressing in the blender. I feel like I have too many vinegars already on hand, so used red wine vinegar instead of buying white. I couldn't find white balsamic vinegar, so substituted what I found, which was golden balsamic vinegar. I also had forgotten to buy fresh oregano, so substituted 1/3 as much dried oregano, and I used extra-virgin olive oil. I mixed the edamame, tomatoes, onions and olives, then added the dressing. I found I needed only half of the dressing, so have kept the rest of the dressing aside, in a container in the fridge. Next time I will reduce those ingredients by half. This helps make the recipe lower in fat, too. The cheese was added just before serving. On re-visiting the left-overs the day after, I have found that even if certain ingredients are left out, it still is terrific! My husband picks out the onion and I pick out the olives, but it's delicious even without those. Some of the salad was left without cheese because there were vegans at the potluck -- and it tastes delicious without the cheese, as well.\nSee More  ",

I had put the Za'aar seasoning,salt and pepper in with the oil and balsamic to mix all together then blended it in with the salad. So yummy and will be making this again.

Roasted chicken would also be an interesting addition to this, I think, to make this a main dish salad. You might just need to add a little bit more dressing. I realized after the dinner was over that I had forgotten to add the parsley to this, and that would have added yet another dimension of flavor to an already fantastic salad, although it tasted great as it was. I am definitely going to be making this again! Thanks, SG!\nSee More  ",

So, i just drizzled and sprinkled ingredients (no fresh basil or oregano, so used dried) to what i felt \"looked\" right/good. Also, I was short on time, so i adjusted temp of oven to 250 to cut down on cooking time (i guess it took me about 3 hours for my batch). Turned out delicious (even the few that were a little overdone). They are so good, we've been eating them like potato chips...but next time, will be sure to keep some on hand for recipes, etc. So yummy...thank you!\n ",

I liked setting the prepared tomatoes cut-side up so that they functioned as miniature bowls. The \"little bowls\" then contained the olive oil and herbs (mostly dried basil with a light touch of course-ground garlic salt) which gradually infused into the tomatoes during dehydration. It took the smaller tomatoes ('Fox' large cherry-type and 'Principe Borghese' Italian drying tomatoes) 6 hours and the larger ('Viva Italia' paste-type) 8+ hours to complete the drying process. Thanks for providing great instructions for homemade \"Sun Dried\" Tomatoes!\n ",

I used extra virgin olive oil, fresh basil, doubled the amount of garlic and didn't use the oregano, personal preference.Then packed then into a small jar with extra virgin oil to preserve them & stored in refrigerator. I plan to make more as soon as I have more ripe roma's these would make a good snack. Thanks for posting this yummy recipe.\n ",
