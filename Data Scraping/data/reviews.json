DH adores this dish, very flexible, have made it for dinner parties and also just for us two. I @ least double the tapenade (because it's soooo good!!), leave out the stuffed olives and only use a tablespoon or so of the capers as they seem to overwhelm the avocado. I usually slice the breasts in half, fry the chicken and serve over linguine or angel hair. Yummmy!!! Thanks for a GREAT dish Smurfetta! :D\n ",

I did double the avocado and added it last so that the color would not turn. I even roasted the garlic and used it in this recipe and then made bruschetta and rubbed the garlic on the pre-toasted bread. I used the black kalamatta olives because that is what I had and I rinsed the olives and the capers (too salty for my taste). Great refreshing summer meal.\n ",
