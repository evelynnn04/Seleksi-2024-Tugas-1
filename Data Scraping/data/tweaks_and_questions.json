I also skipped the cooking spray part and coated my veggies in a large bowl with the oil and herbs. I was a little scared of 2 TBS of vinegar, but it wasn't a problem at all.

A few years ago,I needed a last minute dish to take to a gathering. Looking at what I had on hand and following a whim, I stumbled across a fantastic combo of mixing tabouli with a container of classic tuna salad (not mayonaisy) from Whole Foods. The flavors came together perfectly and it was a huge hit! The whole room wanted the \"recipe\". Since then, when I make tabouli, I often add a can of Albacore tuna to the mix and Wa La(!) - an excellent meal that is appreciated by all. Top with a slice of avocado and you have heaven on a plate. Without fail, recipe requests follow the first bite. It just works. In-joy.\nSee More  ",

        "content": "Tabbouleh has always been something I wanted to make, and this recipe is the one I will use every time! I substituted Quinoa in place of the bulgur, using 1 1/2 cups of dry Quinoa to 3 cups of water and cooking it according to the directions on its package. This made the perfect amount of Quinoa to veggie ratio since I prefer a more balanced salad. Any less Quinoa and I think the parsley would have been too dominant. I used curly leaf parsley, which to me seemed to be just as flavorful as flat leaf but not as pungent. I chopped it very finely and took other's advice and measured 3/4 cup to 1 cup loosely packed. My \"1 bunch\" of green onions was 6 onions, and I used the whole onion-- both the green and the white. Where the recipe calls for 1 medium onion chopped, I only added 1/4 chopped to the salad, and it was a little too strong even with such a small amount. So I suggest using a mild or sweet onion or leaving it out altogether; I thought the green onions gave it great flavor on their own. I used fresh garden mint as well and only needed 1/4 cup or less after it was chopped. I used 16oz fresh cherry tomatoes quartered, and kept the olive oil and red wine vinegar as stated. Quinoa can be a little sticky so the oil really helped keep the texture of traditional tabbouleh. My only additions were 1 English cucumber finely chopped, which boosted the texture and flavor immensely, and about 2Tbls of balsamic vinegar to give the salad just a little bit of sweet without having to worry about granules of sugar showing up in the salad. I served this wonderful dish with hummus, pita bread, kalamata olives, and marinated Greek chicken kabobs (recipe was from a different website). Everyone loved it all!!

        "content": "I doubled the garlic and only had on hand about half the spinach. I, too, used olive oil, and would consider trying it with chicken broth instead of the water. I don't like dill, but I stuck to it and used my dried. I also added a breath of red pepper flakes just before step five, added a splash of lemon at the end of step 7 and I DIDN'T discard the liquid. Very tasty. I had it with some leftover swordfish that I flaked and stirred throughout. This would also be nice over rice or pasta, or with some canned garbanzo or white beans thrown in. The feta was the perfect touch. Would also be nice with fresh shredded parmesan, pine nuts or some cumin. What a nice base! Thanks, Mary! I can't wait to expand on this (or just keep it simple....)!\nSee More  ",

        "content": "I tried this recipe for a potluck and we loved it! (I tripled the recipe.) It is a very aromatic dish that scents the whole house. Mmm! The only changes made were: I snipped the sun-dried tomatoes into small bits and by the time I had added about 2/3 cup of them to the edamame it looked like more would overwhelm the salad, so I didn't triple the amount of sun-dried tomatoes, but sliced and added about a pound of fresh ripe cherry tomatoes, instead. I couldn't find feta cheese, so substituted goat cheese (I read that it's a healthier cheese, anyway, with less fat and less salt). For the dressing (step 2), I decided I would like my garlic pureed, so I mixed the dressing in the blender. I feel like I have too many vinegars already on hand, so used red wine vinegar instead of buying white. I couldn't find white balsamic vinegar, so substituted what I found, which was golden balsamic vinegar. I also had forgotten to buy fresh oregano, so substituted 1/3 as much dried oregano, and I used extra-virgin olive oil. I mixed the edamame, tomatoes, onions and olives, then added the dressing. I found I needed only half of the dressing, so have kept the rest of the dressing aside, in a container in the fridge. Next time I will reduce those ingredients by half. This helps make the recipe lower in fat, too. The cheese was added just before serving. On re-visiting the left-overs the day after, I have found that even if certain ingredients are left out, it still is terrific! My husband picks out the onion and I pick out the olives, but it's delicious even without those. Some of the salad was left without cheese because there were vegans at the potluck -- and it tastes delicious without the cheese, as well.\nSee More  ",
